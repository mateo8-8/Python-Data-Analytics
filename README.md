Python-Data-Analytics

This is a repo with notebooks to teach individuals how to use python for data analytics. In this repo, you can go from a python novice to an intermediate python data analyst.

Combined Lesson Summaries (Lessons 1 to 10)

Lesson 1: Introduction to Python Basics Covers fundamental Python concepts including variables, data types, basic operations, and simple control flow like conditionals and loops.

Lesson 2: Data Structures Introduces core Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, along with common operations to manipulate them.

Lesson 3: Functions and Modules Focuses on writing reusable code through functions, understanding scope, and organizing code using modules and imports.

Lesson 4: File Handling and Exception Management Teaches reading from and writing to files, handling exceptions gracefully, and ensuring robust code execution.

Lesson 5: Data Analysis with Pandas Introduces the pandas library for data manipulation, including loading datasets, cleaning data, filtering, and basic analysis techniques.

Lesson 6: Data Visualization Explores creating visual representations of data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and insights visually.

Lesson 7: NumPy and Array Operations Covers numerical computing with NumPy, focusing on arrays, vectorized operations, and mathematical functions for efficient data processing.

Lesson 8: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Combines data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to explore datasets and formulate hypotheses.

Lesson 9: Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts Provides an overview of machine learning principles, types of learning, and simple algorithm examples.

Lesson 10: Machine Learning Introduction Walks through preparing data, splitting datasets into training and testing sets, training a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, and evaluating model accuracy.
